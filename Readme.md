This is a new repository to collect user contriputed plugins of [opensim]() tools. 

Each plugin must have:
  - source code
    - it would be nice if there is an actuator and plugin as well. 
  - testing models and expected results
  - documentation that explains the math and how to use it. 
  - Libs folder that contains libraries for Windows, Linux, and/or Mac.
    - libraries os version should be mentioned in the documentation.
    - If multiple files are added we can add something like _win10, _Ub18 at the end of the library name
